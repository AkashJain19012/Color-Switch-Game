# Color-Switch-Game
Advanced Programming Project (JAVAFX)

Made Color Switch Game Clone using JavaFx. The game provides features like
saving and loading games by name using serialization, collision detection, fluid animations, etc. The entire game
is implemented using Object Oriented Programming Concepts with proper designing using UML and Class Diagrams.
The game has a classic mode - score as many points as you can (endless) and
teaser mode - under development.
